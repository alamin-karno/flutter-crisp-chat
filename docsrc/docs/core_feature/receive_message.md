# Receive Message

The **Flutter Crisp Chat** plugin allows you to receive messages in real-time. Follow these steps:

## Listen for Messages

To listen for incoming messages, use the Crisp Chat SDK's built-in listeners. For example:

```dart
// Example code for listening to messages
// Add your implementation here
```

## Handle Notifications

Ensure that your app is configured to handle push notifications for incoming messages. Refer to the [Installation](../getting_started/install.md) section for setup instructions.

## Next Steps

After receiving messages, you can customize the chat interface. Refer to the [Customizations](customizations.md) section for more details.
