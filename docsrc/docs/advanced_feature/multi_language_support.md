# Multi-Language Support

The **Flutter Crisp Chat** plugin supports multi-language configurations to enhance user experience for global audiences. Follow these steps to enable multi-language support:

## Set Language

You can set the language for the chat interface using the following method:

```dart
FlutterCrispChat.setLanguage("fr"); // Example: Set language to French
```

## Supported Languages

Refer to the [Crisp Chat Documentation](https://help.crisp.chat/en/) for a list of supported languages.

## Next Steps

After enabling multi-language support, you can configure offline mode. Refer to the [Offline Mode](offline_mode.md) section for more details.
