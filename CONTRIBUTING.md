## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To run and work on this project locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Fork the Repository

- Click the **Fork** button in the top-right corner of the [repository](https://github.com/alamin-karno/flutter-crisp-chat) page.
- Clone your forked repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alamin-karno/flutter-crisp-chat
cd flutter_crisp_chat
```

### 2. Set Up the Example App
The `example` folder contains a Flutter project to test the Crisp Chat plugin.

Youâ€™ll need to add some secrets and configurations to run it properly:

### 3. Add Firebase Support

To run this project, you need to add your Firebase configuration files:

- `android/app/google-services.json`
- `ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist`

These files are not included in this repo for security reasons.

- Create a new Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).

- Add an iOS app and an Android app (optional) and get the Firebase auto setup. `If not then follow below steps`.

- Download the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file for iOS and place it in:
```bash
example/ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist
```
- Download the `google-services.json` file for Android and place it in:
```bash
example/android/app/google-services.json
```

_You may also need to enable Firebase Cloud Messaging if you want to test push notifications._

### 4. Add Crisp Website ID
In the `example/lib/main.dart` or wherever you're calling the Crisp chat, provide your Crisp **Website ID**:

```dart
final String websiteID = "YOUR_WEBSITE_ID";
```
You can get your Website ID from your [Crisp Dashboard](https://app.crisp.chat/).
